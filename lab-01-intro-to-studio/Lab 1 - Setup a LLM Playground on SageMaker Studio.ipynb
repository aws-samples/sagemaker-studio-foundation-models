    "\n",
    "* **max_new_tokens:** Model generates text until the output length (excluding the input context length) reaches max_new_tokens. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **temperature:** Controls the randomness in the output. Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words. If `temperature` -> 0, it results in greedy decoding. If specified, it must be a positive float.\n",
    "* **top_p:** In each step of text generation, sample from the smallest possible set of words with cumulative probability `top_p`. If specified, it must be a float between 0 and 1.\n",

    "You may specify any subset of the parameters mentioned above while invoking an endpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "- If `max_new_tokens` is not defined, the model may generate up to the maximum total tokens allowed, which is 4K for these models. This may result in endpoint query timeout errors, so it is recommended to set `max_new_tokens` when possible. For 7B, 13B, and 70B models, we recommend to set `max_new_tokens` no greater than 1500, 1000, and 500 respectively, while keeping the total number of tokens less than 4K.\n",
    "- In order to support a 4k context length, this model has restricted query payloads to only utilize a batch size of 1. Payloads with larger batch sizes will receive an endpoint error prior to inference.\n",
    "- This model only supports 'system', 'user' and 'assistant' roles, starting with 'system', then 'user' and alternating (u/a/u/a/u...)."
