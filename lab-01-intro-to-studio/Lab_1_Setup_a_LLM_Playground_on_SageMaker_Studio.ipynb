    "To perform inference on these models, you need to pass `custom_attributes='accept_eula=true'` as part of header. This means you have read and accept the end-user-license-agreement (EULA) of the model. EULA can be found in model card description or from https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/. By default, this notebook sets `custom_attribute='accept_eula=false'`, so all inference requests will fail until you explicitly change this custom attribute.\n",

If the user passes the same key more than once, the last value is kept and passed to the script handler (i.e., in this case, used for conditional logic). For example, if `'accept_eula=false; accept_eula=true'` is passed to the server, then `'accept_eula=true'` is kept and passed to the script handler.\n",

    "* **max_new_tokens:** Model generates text until the output length (excluding the input context length) reaches max_new_tokens. If specified, it must be a positive integer.\n",
    "* **temperature:** Controls the randomness in the output. Higher temperature results in output sequence with low-probability words and lower temperature results in output sequence with high-probability words. If `temperature` -> 0, it results in greedy decoding. If specified, it must be a positive float.\n",
    "* **top_p:** In each step of text generation, sample from the smallest possible set of words with cumulative probability `top_p`. If specified, it must be a float between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin with 512, 0.9, and 0.6 for these respectively, though feel free to alter these are we do to see how this may affect the LLM output.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may specify any subset of the parameters mentioned above while invoking an endpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "- If `max_new_tokens` is not defined, the model may generate up to the maximum total tokens allowed, which is 4K for these models. This may result in endpoint query timeout errors, so it is recommended to set `max_new_tokens` when possible. For 7B, 13B, and 70B models, we recommend to set `max_new_tokens` no greater than 1500, 1000, and 500 respectively, while keeping the total number of tokens less than 4K.\n",
    "- In order to support a 4k context length, this model has restricted query payloads to only utilize a batch size of 1. Payloads with larger batch sizes will receive an endpoint error prior to inference.\n",
    "- This model only supports 'system', 'user' and 'assistant' roles, starting with 'system', then 'user' and alternating (u/a/u/a/u...)."

      "**Airports:** As I mentioned earlier, there are three major airports in New York: John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). You can fly from any of these airports to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Flight duration:** As I mentioned earlier, the flight duration from New York to Los Angeles is approximately 5 hours. However, please note that this can vary depending on several factors such as flight route, airline, and weather conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Flight frequency:** There are numerous flights available from New York to Los Angeles, with many airlines operating multiple flights per day. Some popular airlines that operate this route include American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Alaska Airlines.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cost:** The cost of flights from New York to Los Angeles can vary greatly depending on the airline, time of year, and how far in advance you book. On average, you can expect to pay between $200-$500 for a one-way economy ticket.\n",

      "**Tips:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* Be sure to check for any travel restrictions or requirements, such as COVID-19 testing or vaccination certificates.\n",
      "* Book your flight in advance to secure the best prices.\n",
      "* Consider flying into a different airport in Los Angeles, such as Long Beach Airport (LGB) or Burbank Airport (BUR), if you have specific plans or preferences.\n",
      "* Check for any layovers or connections, and plan accordingly.\n",

It is possible to have an unknown chain that depends on the user's input. In these types of chains, there is a “agent” which has access to a suite of tools. Depending on the user input, the agent can then decide which, if any, of these tools to call. An agent could call multiple LLM Chains that we defined above, each with their own tools. They can also be extended with custom logic to allow for retries, and error handling.\n",

      "Summary: The Empire State Building is a 102-story Art Deco skyscraper in the Midtown South neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. The building was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and built from 1930 to 1931. Its name is derived from \"Empire State\", the nickname of the state of New York. The building has a roof height of 1,250 feet (380 m) and stands a total of 1,454 feet (443.2 m) tall, including its antenna. The Empire State Building was the world's tallest building until the first tower of the World Trade Center was topped out in 1970; following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Empire State Building was New York City's tallest building until it was surpassed in 2012 by One World Trade Center. As of 2022, the building is the seventh-tallest building in New York City, the ninth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States, and the 54th-tallest in the world.\n",
      "The site of the Empire State Building, on the west side of Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets, was developed in 1893 as the Waldorf–Astoria Hotel. In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931. Despite favorable publicity related to the building's construction, because of the Great Depression and World War II, its owners did not make a profit until the early 1950s.\n",
      "The building's Art Deco architecture, height, and observation decks have made it a popular attraction. Around four million tourists from around the world annually visit the building's 86th- and 102nd-floor observatories; an additional indoor observatory on the 80th floor opened in 2019. The Empire State Building is an international cultural icon: it has been featured in more than 250 television series and films since the film King Kong was released in 1933. The building's size has been used as a standard of reference to describe the height and length of other structures. A symbol of New York City, the building has been named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. It was ranked first on the American Institute of Architects' List of America's Favorite Architecture in 2007. Additionally, the Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior were designated city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1980, and were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.\n",

      "Summary: On July 28, 1945, a B-25 Mitchell bomber of the United States Army Air Forces crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building in New York City while flying in thick fog. The crash killed fourteen people (three crewmen and eleven people in the building), and an estimated twenty-four others were injured. Damage caused by the crash was estimated at US$1 million (equivalent to about $17 million in 2023), although the building's structural integrity was not compromised.\n",
