    "Prompt engineering is an exciting, new way of making language computer programs, also known as language models, work better for all kinds of jobs and studies. This skill helps us get to know what these big computer programs can do well and what they can't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientists use prompt engineering to make these language models better at doing a bunch of different things, like answering questions or solving math problems. Programmers use it to create strong and useful ways to interact with these big language models and other tech stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "But prompt engineering isn't just about making questions or commands for these models. It's a whole set of skills that help us work better with them. We can use these skills to make the language models safer and even add new features, like making them smarter in specific subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we learn how to:\n",
    "1. use SageMaker to setup and send prompts to a Large Language Model, Mistral 7B Instruct.\n",
    "2. Learn basic and Advanced prompting techniques."

As previously discussed, a well-designed prompt often amalgamates elements like directives, contextual information, and input-output indicators to yield superior outcomes. While incorporating these elements isn't obligatory, doing so tends to be advantageous; specificity in your instructions is directly correlated with the quality of the results you obtain.

       "\n",
       "The process begins deep within the Earth, where heat and pressure cause the mantle to partially melt, creating magma. This magma rises towards the surface due to its lower density compared to the surrounding rock. As it rises, it can encounter various obstacles, such as the solid crust or other magma chambers. These obstacles can cause the magma to build up, creating a volcano.\n",
       "\n",
       "During an eruption, the magma is expelled from the volcano, often accompanied by volcanic ash, gas, and other volcanic materials. Over time, repeated eruptions can build up the volcano, creating a conical shape. The size and shape of a volcanic mountain can depend on various factors, including the composition and amount of magma, the frequency and duration of eruptions, and the tectonic setting.\n",
       "\n",
       "Additionally, volcanic mountains can form in different ways, such as through the divergent tectonic process (where magma rises from the mantle due to the separation of tectonic plates), convergent tectonic process (where magma rises due to the collision of tectonic plates), or hotspot volcanism (where magma rises from a hot spot in the mantle).\n",
